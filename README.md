Hi, I'm Jumie 👋
Medical Physicist | Software Engineer | Building AI Tools for Healthcare
I'm on a mission to bridge medical physics and software engineering to create AI-driven tools that improve cancer treatment and healthcare delivery.

🔬 My Unique Background
I started my career in medical physics with hands-on clinical experience in radiation oncology:

🎓 BSc Physics from University of Medical Sciences, Nigeria
🏥 Clinical internships at MEDSERVE-LUTH Cancer Centre (Lagos) working with Varian Halcyon linear accelerators
📊 Performed daily QA, calibrations, and treatment planning support for IMRT/VMAT radiation therapy
📄 Published researcher: Absorbed Dose Measurements from Halcyon Linear Accelerator (Iranian Journal of Medical Physics, 2023)

After working with radiotherapy machines, I realized there's a critical shortage of professionals who understand both:

Clinical physics requirements (dosimetry, treatment planning, safety protocols)
Software engineering (building the computational tools that power modern cancer treatment)

So I made a deliberate transition into software development, spending 3+ years building healthcare applications.

💻 What I Do Now
I specialize in building production-ready healthcare applications with focus on:

⚛️ Frontend Development: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript
🏥 Healthcare Systems: Secure data handling, HIPAA-aware development
🔐 Authentication & Security: OAuth, Supabase, role-based access control
📊 Real-time Data: API integration, data synchronization
♿ Accessibility: Building interfaces for diverse user demographics

Recent Impact:

🎯 90% data accuracy in production systems
⚡ 80% faster processing times
📈 85% user adoption rates


🚀 Featured Projects
🏥 MedBloc - Healthcare Data Management System
A full-stack healthcare application for secure patient-provider data sharing
The Problem: Healthcare providers need secure, efficient ways to share patient data while maintaining privacy and compliance.
My Solution:

Built secure authentication system with role-based access control
Implemented encrypted data transfer for sensitive medical information
Created responsive, intuitive UI for patients, doctors, and administrators
Enabled real-time data synchronization across healthcare teams

Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
Status: Functional prototype deployed and used for training purposes
Why This Matters: This project combines my medical physics background (understanding clinical workflows) with software engineering (building secure, scalable systems).
